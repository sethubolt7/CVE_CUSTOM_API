# CVE_CUSTOM_API
This repository contains a backend using Spring Boot, JPA, and H2 to manage and display over 10,000 CVE records. It fetches CVE data from a public source, stores it in H2, and provides custom endpoints with filtering by year, metric score, and last modified date. Built with MVC architecture for structured data handling and web page integration.
